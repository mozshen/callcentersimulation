## Call Center Simulation
### Dicrete Event Simulation Project

We modeled and coded a multi-queue call center system using python. The project phases were modeling, coding, data analysis, sensitivity analysis, and optimization.

Using data analysis and sensitivity analysis, we compared the effect of different policies on the KPIs that we created to optimize the performance of the system. These KPIs are calculated using the data generated from the model.

We also used statistical methods to estimate the model parameters and fit a distribution to them using the given data.
Used libraries: pandas/numpy/scipy/matplotlib/seaborn
